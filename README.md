# EDX FE Bootcamp Challenge Three: Bootstrap-Portfolio

## The Task

The task for the third module was to create a portfolio using the Bootstrap utility classes and methods we have learned so far.
This included creating a simple one-pager that included components such as Navbar, Jumbotron, Rows/Cols and Footer.

### HTML
This project provided no starter code, so a standard HTML boilerplate was used to set the foundation of the page. This also included relative CDN links to Bootstrap and an icons CDN. There was a relevant title given and the page was generated to use semantic HTML elements and sections. Most of the styling was using Bootstrap utility classes.

### CSS
The CSS was organised in the way of the waterfall page. For this project, as we used Bootstrap classes, a minimal amount of styling was created in the CSS file which included small spacing changes or background-color changes for sections.
